Welcome to the Creable API documentation! This API provides various endpoints to pull various data points from Creable.

## Authentication

Authentication for the Creable API is done using an API key provided in the `X-Api-Key` header of your HTTP requests.

### Obtaining an API Key

To access the API, you need to obtain an API key by requesting API access to Creable. Once we approve your request, you'll receive an API key unique to your account.

### Including the API Key

You should include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header of all your API requests. Without a valid API key, you won't be able to access our services.

#### Example

```http
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: https://api.creable.com/api/v1/endpoint
X-Api-Key: your-api-key-here
```

### Security

We take security seriously. Never share your API key with anyone, and make sure to store it securely. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate it from your account settings.
